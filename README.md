**Big Integer** is a structure for the implementation of multiple precision arithmetic.



# To do...

+ Create classes for exceptions
+ Function for the computation of the quotient and remainder of two multi-precision numbers
+ In any non constant object function check the sign for the case of zero
+ State the power - sum inequality b^n >= \sum_0^n-1 b^i (done)
+ Change Positive to NonNegative (Done)
